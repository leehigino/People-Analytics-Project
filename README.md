# People-Analytics-Project
This People Analytics project analyzes employee turnover and attrition risk using SQL, Python, and Power BI. It identifies key drivers such as tenure, income, job level, satisfaction, and work-life balance, builds a composite risk score, and delivers executive dashboards to support data-driven retention decisions for HR leaders at scale.
